<h1 align="center">ðŸ”¥ Rec4TS: Evaluating System 1 vs. 2 Reasoning Approaches for Zero-Shot Time-Series Forecasting ðŸ”¥</h1>



REC4TS is the first benchmark that evaluates the effectiveness of reasoning strategies for zero-shot time series forecasting (TSF) tasks.

Specifically, REC4TS try to answer two research questions:

-**RQ1: Can zero-shot TSF benefit from enhanced reasoning ability?**

-**RQ2: What kind of reasoning strategies does zero-shot TSF need?**

REC4TS covers three cognitive systems: Direct Sytem 1 (e.g. gpt-4o) ; the test-time enhanced System 1 (e.g., gpt-4o with Chain-of-Thought ) and System 2 (e.g. o1-mini).

*Since reasoning strategies for foundational time-series models have not yet been studied and are difficult to implement directly, we have to reuse foundational language models to explore effective TSF
reasoning strategies. We envision that our benchmark and insights offer promising potential for future research on understanding and designing effective reasoning strategies for zero-shot TSF.

## Key  Insights

0. Good News: reasoning is helpful for zero-shot TSF!
1. Self-consistency is currently the most effective reasoning strategy
2. Group-relative policy optimization enbaled DeepSeek-R1 is the only effective System 2 reasoning strategy
3. Multimodal TSF benefits more from reasoning strategies than unimodal TSF
4. The TimeT-hinking dataset:  containing reasoning trajectories of multiple advanced LLMs
5. A new and simple test-time scaling on foundation time-series modelsï¼šbased on self-consistency reasoning strategies and inspired by our insights

## Reasoning Strategies

- `naive`: Direct system 1 generation
- `cot`: Chain-of-thought reasoning
- `self_consistency`: Multiple predictions with averaging
- `self_correction`: Self-correction of initial predictions
- `lrm`: Using System 2 Models, also known as Large Reasoning Models

## Experiment Results

Experiment results are saved in the `experiment_results` directory in JSON format. 

## Collecting Results

To show experiment results, use the Jupyter notebook `A_DrawLatex.ipynb`. It will show the results in the form of LaTeX tables.



### Custom Data

To use your own data, prepare CSV files with the following format:
- Time series data: Date column and value column
- Text data: Date column and fact/news column

Place your data files in the `data` directory.

### Custom Models

To use different LLM providers, modify the `LLM_list` and `LRM_list` variables in `A_Demo.py` or `A_Run_Exp.py`:

```python
LRM_list = ["openai/o1-mini-2024-09-12", "google/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219:free", "deepseek/deepseek-r1"]
LLM_list = ['openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13', "google/gemini-2.0-flash-001", "deepseek/deepseek-chat"]
```
